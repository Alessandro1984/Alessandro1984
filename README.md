### Hi everybody, my name is <a href="https://www.alessandrobramucci.com/" target="_blank">Alessandro</a> ğŸ‘‹ğŸ˜ƒ

- ğŸ’» I'm currently working on some projects whose goal is to teach macroeconomics interactively. The projects are developed entirely in R and RStudio. Here you can have a <a href="http://example.com/](https://wiposim-fiscalpolicy-course.netlify.app/" target="_blank">preview</a> of one of the chapters I am currently working on
- ğŸ“ˆ I am very passionate about macroeconomic modelling and macroeconomic data analysis
- ğŸ“Š In the past semesters I have taught introductory courses in econometrics where students have the opportunity to learn how to manage data and perform descriptive statistics and linear regressions analyis using R (and several other packages, e.g. *ggplot2*, *dplyr*).
