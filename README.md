### Hi everybody, my name is <a href="https://www.alessandrobramucci.com/" target="_blank">Alessandro</a> ðŸ‘‹ðŸ˜ƒ

- ðŸ’» I have 5+ years of experience in developing academic projects with the goal to teach macroeconomics interactively. The projects are developed entirely in R and RStudio. Here you can have a <a href="https://wiposim-fiscalpolicy-course.netlify.app/" target="_blank">preview</a> of one of the chapters
- ðŸ“ˆ I am very passionate about macroeconomic modelling and macroeconomic data analysis
- ðŸ“Š I also teach introductory courses in econometrics where students have the opportunity to learn how to manage data, perform descriptive statistics and run linear regressions using R (and several R packages, e.g. *dplyr*, *ggplot2*).
