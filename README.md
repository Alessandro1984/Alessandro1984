### Hi everybody, my name is <a href="https://www.alessandrobramucci.com/" target="_blank">Alessandro</a> 👋😃

- 💻 I have 5+ years of experience in academic projects with the goal to teach macroeconomics interactively. The projects are developed entirely in R and RStudio. Here you can have a <a href="https://wiposim-fiscalpolicy-course.netlify.app/" target="_blank">preview</a> of one of the chapters
- 👨‍💻 Recently I participated to the fantastic 9-weeks Le Wagon bootcamp in Data Science where I had the opportunity to learn the fundamentals of machine learning and deep learning using Python. My group's final project focused on forecasting inflation using deep learning techniques
- 📊 Currently I am teaching introductory courses in economics, econometrics and data analytics at the HWR Berlin
