### Hi everybody, my name is [Alessandro](https://www.alessandrobramucci.com/) 👋😃

- 💻 I am working on some projects whose goal is to teach macroeconomics interactively. The projects are developed entirely in R and RStudio. 
- 📈 Here you can a [preview](https://wiposim-fiscalpolicy-course.netlify.app/) of one of the chapters I am currently working on.
- 📊 I am also teaching an introductory course to econometrics where students learn how to manage data and perform descriptive statistics analyis and linear regressions using R (and several packages, e.g. *dplyr*).
