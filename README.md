### Hi everybody, my name is [Alessandro](https://www.alessandrobramucci.com/) 👋😃

- 💻 I'm currently working on some projects whose goal is to teach macroeconomics interactively. The projects are developed entirely in R and RStudio. Here you can a [preview](https://wiposim-fiscalpolicy-course.netlify.app/) of one of the chapters I am currently working on.
- 📈 I am very passionate about macroeconomic modelling and macroeconomic data analysis
- 📊 In the past semesters I have taught introductory courses to econometrics where students have the opportunity to learn how to manage data and perform descriptive statistics and linear regressions analyis using R (and other several packages, e.g. *dplyr*).
